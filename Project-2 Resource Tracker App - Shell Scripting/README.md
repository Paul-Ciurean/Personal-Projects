# Create a Resource Tracker App using Shell scripts

## Welcome to the AWS Resource Tracker project, where we leverage Shell scripting to build a streamlined monitoring solution for your AWS environment. With our script, you can effortlessly track EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and IAM users within your AWS account.

## Our project guides you through setting up the environment, configuring AWS credentials, and creating the monitoring script. By utilizing tools like jq, we parse JSON output to extract essential data from AWS API responses, providing clear insights into your resource inventory.

## The monitoring script delivers concise output, enabling quick access to information such as EC2 instance IDs, S3 bucket names, IAM user names, and Lambda function names. We also explore techniques for improving output readability, storing results for future reference, and expanding functionality to include additional AWS services.

## Whether you're a DevOps pro streamlining AWS resource management or a Shell scripting novice, our project equips you with practical skills to monitor and manage your cloud resources effectively. Join us on this journey to empower your AWS monitoring efforts with Shell scripts.
