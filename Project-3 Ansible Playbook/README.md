# Project 3 - Ansible

# Develops Ansible skills by doing hands-on with Ansible

## Welcome to Ansible Project! In this beginner-friendly project, we introduce Ansible, an open-source automation tool that simplifies server, application, and infrastructure management.

## Ansible stands out for its simplicity, agentless nature, and versatility. Using plain English and YAML files, it makes automation accessible to all, from DevOps experts to novices. With Ansible, you automate tasks without installing agents on target servers, communicating via SSH or WinRM.

## This project guides you through setting up your environment, installing Ansible, and creating your inaugural playbook. You'll automate the installation of Nginx on target servers, learning key Ansible components such as Control Node, Managed Nodes, Playbooks, and Modules along the way.

## After writing your playbook, you'll execute it using Ansible's 'ansible-playbook' command. Upon completion, you'll verify Nginx installation on target servers, cementing your understanding of Ansible's automation capabilities.

## By completing Ansible Project, you lay the groundwork for future automation endeavors, equipped with essential Ansible knowledge and skills.
